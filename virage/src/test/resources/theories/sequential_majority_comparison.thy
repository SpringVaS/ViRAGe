(*** Definition: Sequential Majority Comparison ***)
(**************************************************)

(* Sequential majority comparison compares 2 alternatives by plurality. The loser gets rejected, the
   winner is compared to the next alternative. This process is repeated, until the a single
   alternative is left. This alternative gets elected.
*)
definition SMC :: "'a rel \<Rightarrow> 'a Electoral_module" where
  "SMC x \<equiv> let a = Max_aggregator; t = Defer_eq_condition 1 in
    ((((Pass_module 2 x) \<triangleright> ((Plurality_module\<down>) \<triangleright> (Pass_module 1 x))) \<parallel>\<^sub>a
      (Drop_module 2 x)) \<circlearrowleft>\<^sub>t) \<triangleright> Elect_module"

(* As all base components are electoral modules (, aggregators, or termination conditions), and all
   used compositional structures create electoral modules, sequential majority comparison
   unsurprisingly is an electoral module.
*)
theorem SMC_sound:
  assumes order: "linear_order x"

(*** (Weak) Monotonicity of Sequential Majority Comparison ***)
(*************************************************************)

(* The following proof is a fully modular proof of the weak monotonicity of sequential majority
   comparison. It is subdivided into many small steps. Used theorems are stated in comments after
   each step. We hope this makes following along with this proof easier.

(* The sequential majority comparison electoral module is electing. This property is needed to
   convert electoral modules to a social choice function. Apart from the very last proof step, it is
