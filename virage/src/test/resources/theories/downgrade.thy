   deferres the originally elected alternatives. It does not elect alternatives. *)
fun Downgrade :: "'a Electoral_module \<Rightarrow> 'a Electoral_module" where

(* Downgrading an electoral module results in an electoral module. *)
theorem downgrade_sound[simp]:
  assumes module: "electoral_module m"
  shows "electoral_module (Downgrade m)"
proof -
  from module have "\<forall>A p. finite_profile A p \<longrightarrow> elect m A p \<subseteq> A"
    using elect_from_input by auto
  hence "\<forall>A p. finite_profile A p \<longrightarrow> (A - elect m A p) \<union> elect m A p = A"
    by blast
  hence unity: "\<forall>A p. finite_profile A p \<longrightarrow> unify_to A (Downgrade m A p)"
    by simp
  have "\<forall>A p. finite_profile A p \<longrightarrow> (A - elect m A p) \<inter> elect m A p = {}"

(* An electoral module received by downgrading is never electing. *)
theorem downgrade_non_electing[simp]:

  shows "non_electing (m\<down>)"

(* Downgrading an invariant monotone electoral module results in a defer invariant monotone
   electoral module.
*)
theorem invariant_monotone_downgrade[simp]:
  assumes "invariant_monotone m"
  shows "defer_invariant_monotone (m\<down>)"
proof -
  have "\<forall>A p q w. (w \<in> defer (m\<down>) A p \<and> lifted A p q w) \<longrightarrow>
                  (defer (m\<down>) A q = defer (m\<down>) A p \<or> defer (m\<down>) A q = {w})"
    using assms by (simp add: invariant_monotone_def)
  moreover have "electoral_module (m\<down>)"
    using assms downgrade_sound invariant_monotone_def by auto
  moreover have "non_electing (m\<down>)"
    using assms downgrade_non_electing invariant_monotone_def by auto
  ultimately have "electoral_module (m\<down>) \<and> non_electing (m\<down>) \<and>
      (\<forall>A p q w. (w \<in> defer (m\<down>) A p \<and> lifted A p q w) \<longrightarrow>
