=== Improve UI
re-add "?-" or ">" if possible (I still think that this does not work while using exec:exec)
sanitize inputs
check necessity of log messages
display types instead of Prolog variables in the end
add possibility to check all available properties at once
omit anonymous variables and fill automatically

=== Miscellaneous
document and rework the (E)PL format (this time for real)
experiment with snap on Ubuntu
interactively launch scala and generate test instances
optionally run jobs in parallel on CLI
document program states
run on different sessions to see behavior
only compile scala code twice if the second run might work
cross-verification of Scala and C programs
add more C snippets

=== FINISHED
move config to a reasonable place (URGENT!!!)
line breaks in help
display purpose description + exit command at startup
more options for yes/no, only check first letter?
"typical value on your system"
remove 8.x
new lines between sections
force restart
"these values were read from the configuration"
improve version displays
auto-open config in system text editor (only "windowed" editors supported for now)
endless loop on Isabelle startup (URGENT!!!)
"successfully verified" instead of "automatically"
improve (E)PL generation message
check Prolog files at version display
more transparent "parsing (E)PL message"
add license (MIT?)
document and rework the (E)PL format (URGENT!!!) (Rudimentary, but the most urgent problem (indistinguishable types for compositional structures) is solved)
check versions
remove tabs
check lifecycle, add compile or find something more elegant
improve exec:exec section (Is it actually that bad? See first example at https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/examples/example-exec-for-java-programs.html)
do not overwrite framework.pl, or at least ask first!
"general release-readiness" -> see BEAST (Was that everything?)
